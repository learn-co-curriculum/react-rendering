# React Rendering

## Objectives

1. Explain what happens when React renders a component
2. Explain why `render()` must be idempotent
3. Describe the parts of the component lifecycle leading up to and coming after
   `render()`

The Circle of Life. Who knew learning about the React framework could bring us to Lion King? As with every creature in
the animal kingdom, React components get created and destroyed only once. The majority of their lifetime is spent
on updating - that is, reacting to user interactions.

We are kindly provided with 4 lifecycle methods to help us handle updates:`componentWillReceiveProps`,
`shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentWillUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate`.

These methods always get called in the same order and the `render()` method which renders the React component into
the DOM will be called just before `componentDidUpdate`, so the actual order of lifecycle methods being called is:

1. `componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)`

2. `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`

3. `componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`

4. `render()` (can access props and state via `this.props` and `this.state` - previous props are no longer available)

5. `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)` (can still access current props and state via `this.props` and
`this.state` and this is the last time previous props and state will be available as they are passed into the function).

### `componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)`
This method is called when the component is receiving new props from it's parent. A word of caution: a common mistake
here is to assume that the props have changed. Just because the method is called doesn't necessarily mean that the props
have changed.

You could use this method for recording a trend between current and previous props. For example, imagine an open air
theater with people coming in and out. You would be interested in the trend of people's movement - are more people
coming in (audience increasing) or leaving (audience decreasing). In a lifecycle method, you might denote it as follows:

```javascript
componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps){
  this.setState({
    audienceIncreasing: nextProps.numAudienceMembers > this.props.numAudienceMembers,
    audienceDecreasing: nextProps.numAudienceMembers < this.props.numAudienceMembers
  })
}
```

### `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
`shouldComponentUpdate` is the odd one out in the lifecycle methods as it doesn't operate on the state, but has a
`Boolean` return value determining whether the component should update or not. It's useful to prevent un-necessary
re-renders and making your website faster (this is useful especially when your application gets really big!).

```javascript
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  return (this.props.myImportantValue !== nextProps.myImportantValue);
}
```

For example, the above code means that the React component gets re-rendered when `myImportantValue` has changed. A word
of caution though: you might think it'd be a good idea to use the `shouldComponentUpdate` function to only re-render the
component if *any* of the props have changed and avoid *all* redundant re-renders, e.g. if `this.props !== nextProps`.
However, because `props` and `nextProps` are both JavaScript objects, this comparison will always return `true`, that
is `{} === {}` is never `true` in JavaScript (object equality is one of the many, many JavaScript quirks out there...
The reasons behind it are a bit too advanced to explain at this stage, it's enough just to know about it. Further
reading [here](http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/object-equality-in-javascript.html).

Coming back to our theater metaphor, imagine a play is being carried out over and over. The actors have a script they
read from and generally don't deviate from it. However, suppose the director decides that a new version of the script
is in order - maybe he felt the audience didn't like a scene, or maybe he just fancied an experiment, either way,
the actors have a new script and have to carry out the play in a slightly different way. As a lifecycle method, this could
be denoted like this:

```javascript
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  return (this.props.scriptVersion !== nextProps.scriptVersion);
}
```

### `componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
**componentWillUpdate** is called immediately after the check in **shouldComponentUpdate** has passed. No state changes
are allowed in this method and it should be used solely for preparing for the upcoming update, not trigger one. One of
the more common uses of **componentWillUpdate** is to to call an action, set a variable or start an animation (not in
the state) based on state changes.

In the theater, this method would be used to set up the stage following a script change: maybe you need a different
background for a scene, new costumes, more upbeat music etc. All of this would be done just before the `render()`
method, or, in our case, just before the new script is read out.

### `render()`
The `render()` method is the most familiar one to all React developers. In fact, in everyday development, we often end
up writing React components that only use the `render()` method! At this stage, the next props and state have become
available from `this.props` and `this.state` and the component gets rendered into the DOM.

For our theater, this is where the play is being carried out: no changes are being made to the script or the scenery
at this stage, it is purely taking the script the director is happy with and the props that have been laid out, and
carrying out the play.

### `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
This method used very often, but it is a kind of a looking back to the opdate that's just occurred. We will have access
to both the current props and previous props. A common use case for this would be to update a 3rd party library.

```javascript
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
   if (prevProps.height !== this.props.height) {
     someChartLibrary.updateHeight(this.props.height);
   }
  }
```

In our theater world, this could be a critic looking back at the play that was just performed and giving it a different
review. For example, perhaps the new version of the play contains more adult language and has to have a more adult rating.

## Summary
These are all the tools we get to help us decide how to react to changes in our component. The `render()` method is the
only one we *must* have - everything else is optional. Use these methods sparingly. In the ideal world, we want to have
as little of them methods as possible.

### Updating lifecycle methods
Not called on initial render, but always called whenever a subsequent re-render is triggered:

|           Method          | nextProps | nextState | Can call `this.setState` |                       Called when?                      |                                     Used for                                     |
|:-------------------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `componentWillReceiveProps` |    yes    |     no    |           yes          |  many times, whenever component is going to receive new props  |                     applying state changes based on new props                    |
|   `shouldComponentUpdate`   |    yes    |    yes    |           no           |    many times, whenever a re-render has been triggered    |    deciding based on new & old props & state whether a re-render should occur    |
|    `componentWillUpdate`    |    yes    |    yes    |           no           | many times, when new state and props are being received | prepare for the update, dispatch any actions or animations based on state change |
|     `componentDidUpdate`    |    yes*   |    yes*   |           yes          |    many times, just after the re-render has finished    | any DOM updates following a render (mostly interacting with 3rd party libraries) |

\* `componentDidUpdate` will actually receive `prevProps` and `prevState` as arguments, as the newly applied state and props can be accessed through `this.props` and `this.state`.
